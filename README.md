# Stock Price Predictor

*This is the final project of the course Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence.*

## Contents
### [Part 1: Explore Nasdaq Dataset](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/6f8c71a8f700b6f6c60c3cd85ff3cb0508aba7ce/1.%20data_nasdaq)
1. Basic CNN for a sample stock - AAL.
2. Improve LSTM for the top 30 companies (big cap).

### [Part 2: Explore Vietnamese Dataset](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/f0766f97271e91bc7e6bfb18f648d32497d9efe6/2.%20data_vn_20230228)
1. Basic CNN for a sample stock - VNM.
2. Improved LSTM for the bank sector.
3. Pratice RNN on VN30 Index.

### [Part 3: Identify Trading Points](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/f0766f97271e91bc7e6bfb18f648d32497d9efe6/3.%20identify-trading-points)
Signal Rolling Agent to predict the buying and selling points with a specific delay.

### [Part 4: Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/f0766f97271e91bc7e6bfb18f648d32497d9efe6/4.%20portfolio_optimization)
Apply a linear regression technique to identify the correlation state benchmark, which categorizes the most and least optimal stocks given a bunch of tickers.

### [Part 5: Helper Functions](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/f0766f97271e91bc7e6bfb18f648d32497d9efe6/helper_functions)
It contains some helper functions to preprocess and visualize the data.

The models' primary goal is to forecast the next 7 days based on the last 30 days. You can increase it locally if you want by tuning the parameters.
