# Stock Price Predictor

*This is the final project of the course Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence.*

## Contents
### [Part 1: Explore Nasdaq Dataset](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/main/1.%20data_nasdaq)
1. Basic CNN for a sample stock - AAL.
2. Improve LSTM for top 30 companies (big cap).

### [Part 2: Explore Vietnamese Dataset](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/main/2.%20data_vn_20230228)
1. Basic CNN for a sample stock - VNM.
2. Improved LSTM for the bank sector.
3. Pratice RNN on VN30 Index.

### [Part 3: Identify Trading Points](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/main/3.%20identify-trading-points)
Signal Rolling Agent to predict the buying and selling points with a specific delays.

### [Part 4: Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/main/4.%20portfolio_optimization)
Apply a linear regression technique to identify the benchmark of the correlation state, which categorize the most and least optimal stocks given a bunch of tickers.

### [Part 5: Helper Functions](https://github.com/hallie304/stock-price-predictor/tree/main/helper_functions)
Contain some helper functions to preprocess and visualize the data.

The primary goal of the models is to forecasting the next 7 dayes based on the last 30 days. You can increase if locally if you want by tuning the parameters.
